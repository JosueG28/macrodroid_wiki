# 📱 Welcome to the Unofficial MacroDroid Wiki

**Project created and maintained by [Josué García](https://github.com/JosueG28)**

This project was created in my free time with the goal of offering a clear, structured, and constantly updated source of information about **MacroDroid**.  
Because it’s developed during available spare time, updates may not be as fast as I’d like.  
If you’d like to support this project, you can do so through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/josueg28).  
☕ — every bit of support is greatly appreciated!
